the_gloaming

"Music is a place."

macOS only (Apple Silicon)

What it is:
the_gloaming is a local music library manager built for collectors and audiophiles. It's for people with folders full of FLACs. Nerds with metadata compulsion.

Features:

True gapless playback (via native Swift audio engine)

Records, not "albums": with artwork, ephemera, and metadata

Cassettes: hand-curated playlists with custom cover art

Programs: generative radio stations built from rules you define

Ledgers: Time-based listening stats that respect attention

No cloud. No accounts. No recommendations. Just your music.


How it was built:
I'm not a developer. I built this over (2 months. the old copy was written early and hastily pasted in) by collaborating with Claude. I used one instance in a Claude Project for big-picture design and architecture when the codebase outgrew the context window. This instance heard me out and created handoffs that I brought to Claude Code.
I'm sharing this because I think it's interesting, not because I think everyone should do it this way. I have always wanted an app like this, and actually, what I've found is that this process has made me want to learn more about coding. My dream app is sitting in my dock and I can hardly believe it.
License: GPL v3. Free forever.

DMG ready in releases!
